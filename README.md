# css-for-sponsor-page
It is never a good idea to put css in a body field. In this case, the compnay I was working for wanted a personalized sponsor page for our local Drupal Camp. I was only able to gain access to that specific page. The css in this repo is how I chose to solve the issue and make everyone happy.
